THE DATASET
This repository contains three files:
(1) 'Readme.txt': this readme file
(2) 'run_analysis.R': an R script that will process the original data and produce a tidy dataset. This tidy dataset
contains an average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the original data.
(3) a codebook explaining the variables in the dataset that the codebook creates.
